<div>Hi, with these few words I've decided to drag this blog into existence. It's primarily come about because I went on a domain registration spree and captured the wonderful <a href="http://www.corkery.me/">www.corkery.me</a> but also because I'd previously created this blogger account in a failed attempt to get early access to the Google Places API.<br /><br />I already have a blog focusing on technical/programming themes over at <a href="http://www.kramkroc.com/">www.kramkroc.com</a> but I hope to focus on life outside of work/professional and pretend I have other interests. I'm not sure what those topics may be, but I look forward to recording them here.</div>
