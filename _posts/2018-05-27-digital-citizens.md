## Coolest Projects 2018 - Parents Panel

On Saturday the 26th of May, I had the privilege to take part in a Parents Panel discussion during Coolest Projects 2018. The topic was _"Bringing Young People on the path to being a good a good digital citizen"_ which is something close to my heart as I'm a parent myself and also a Champion for CoderDojo Banbridge. In the past I have also visited primary school classes to give talks on the subject of _Online Safety_ as well.

### What is Coolest Projects?

Coolest Projects is a series of annual events ran by regional CoderDojo orgnizations across the world. The largest (to date) event is the International Coolest Projects which has been hosted from the RDS in Dublin for a number of years now. 

It is an event that is open to all kids (aged 7 to 17) who attend either CoderDojo, CodeClub or Raspberry Jam. It has a competitive element but is really a place for kids to both showcase their own skills but to also be inspired by their peers. 

As well as the great projects from the kids, there are also a tonne of awesome sessions being hosted by both the sponsors of the event as well as a number of education charities and a number of inspiring talks aimed at both parents and the ninjas in attendance.
