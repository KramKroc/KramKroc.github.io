## Coolest Projects 2018 - Parents Panel

On Saturday the 26th of May, I had the privilege of taking part in a Parents Panel discussion during Coolest Projects 2018. The topic was _"Bringing Young People on the path to being a good a good digital citizen"_ which is something close to my heart as I'm a parent myself and also a Champion for CoderDojo Banbridge. In the past I have also visited primary school classes to give talks on the subject of _Online Safety_ as well.

### What is Coolest Projects?

Coolest Projects is a series of annual events ran by regional CoderDojo organisations across the world. The largest (to date) event is the International Coolest Projects which has been hosted from the RDS in Dublin for a number of years now.

It is an event that is open to all kids (aged 7 to 17) who attend either CoderDojo, CodeClub or Raspberry Jam. It has a competitive element but is really a place for kids to both showcase their own skills but to also be inspired by their peers.

As well as the great projects from the kids, there are also a tonne of awesome sessions being hosted by both the sponsors of the event as well as a number of education charities and a number of inspiring talks aimed at both parents and the ninjas in attendance.

### The Panel

The discussion was being hosted by [Elaine Burke](https://twitter.com/CriticalRedPen), managing editor of [Silicon Republic](siliconrepublic.com). In the hot seats were *Alex Cooney*, CEO of [CyberSafe Ireland](cybersafeireland.org), *Chris Flack*, Founder of [UnPlug](unplughq.com), and [Brendan Gormley](https://twitter.com/bgormley), representing [OWASP](https://twitter.com/OWASPDublin) and myself.

This was my first (and last?) discussion panel and in the build up I was equally nervous and excited about the event. In the end it went pretty well, but that was almost a given in that all panellist were in broad agreement, with each calling out specific aspects that would have been of particular interest to each given their background.

### How to Become Informed Parents?

If I were to summarise the main core of my advice from the panel, it would be that parents need to take the time to become as informed as they can be. Most kids are getting some form of exposure to concepts of online safety and being a good digital citizen through their schools or youth groups. Parents in the main aren't but the good news is that there are loads of fantastic sites out there that are really accessible and do a great job of providing information in easily consumable chunks.
