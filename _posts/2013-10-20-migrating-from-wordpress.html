<span style="font-weight: normal;">I've maintained a dual blogging identity for the last few years. Previously this blog merely contained blog entries on non-work related activities that I got up to. It was updated on a less than regular basis but I hope that is about to change as I've decided to migrate my other blog from wordpress.com which dealt primarily with more technical content. The reason, I simply let the domain that was hosting it expire and I don't feel a great urge to renew it. As a result I've copied over my existing content using the guidance in&nbsp;<a href="http://google.about.com/od/googleblogger/a/How-To-Move-Your-Blog-From-Wordpress-To-Blogger.htm" target="_blank">this article</a>&nbsp;and hope that the future will be awesome right here.</span>
