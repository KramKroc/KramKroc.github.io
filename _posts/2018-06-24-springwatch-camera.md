## A Project that Combines Tech & Nature? I'm in!

I recently stumbled across a _tweet_ from [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/) about the awesome [My Naturewatch Camera](https://mynaturewatch.net/) project that allows you to build your own, _cheap_ motion based nature camera which you can set up at your birdfeeder with little effort. I thought I'd document the mis/steps I took to get my own up and running.

The site contains [excellant instructions](https://mynaturewatch.net/daylight-camera-instructions) that are pitched at the right level for both novices and comfortable hackers alike. 

For my project, I originally planned to use an old soup and an dold sauce plastic containers. I also don't own a drill and so used an alternative technique of heating a Philips headed screwdriver for 10 to 15 seconds and pushing it firmly over the location of where you wanted to position your camera hole.
