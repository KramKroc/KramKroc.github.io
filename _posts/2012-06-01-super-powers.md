While out cycling this evening, I discovered that my four week break (initially due to a dodgy hip injury) has had a positive and unexpected bonus - a development of hitherto underutilized powers of invisibility!

So far, and I believe honesty is the best policy here, I have yet to fully master control of these new gifts. I'd better explain what I mean by detailing a few highlights from my spin this evening.

About a minute before I unearthed my powers, I was most certainly not invisible. Pedaling on to a roundabout near the Outlet in Banbridge I spotted two kids cycling the wrong way around it. Before I had a chance to offer some safe road advice, they clocked me and shouted out _"Wanker"_ which obviously highlighted that I was visible to normal human sight.

Cycling on, I exited the roundabout and tucked in behind a car that overtook me and then came up to the next roundabout.

No traffic was entering to the right so both the car ahead of me and I moved into the roundabout. Once the car proceeding me passed the next junction, the car that was waiting there drove onto the roundabout, cutting across me even though I was no more than six feet behind the car ahead of me.

Before you try and say that the guy driving the car obviously didn't spot me, I'd just like to point out that I'm over six foot tall, was wearing a bright yellow top and also had at that time a bright red face so should have been hard to miss!

Anyway, with awesome power comes awesome responsibility so I'll try to remember to post here with any progress I make over the next few months.
