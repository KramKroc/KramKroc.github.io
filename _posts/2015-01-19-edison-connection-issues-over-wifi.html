I've been trying to get up to speed with the excellent <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="_blank">cylon.js</a>&nbsp;library for a while now so finally carved out some time to try to set it up and running on an <a href="http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html" target="_blank">edison</a> board and the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/xdk-iot" target="_blank">Intel XDK</a> IDE but I ran into a very fundamental roadblock...I couldn't connect my laptop to the Edison over my home wifi network (which by normal <a href="https://github.com/mashery/edison-guides/wiki/Intel-Edison-Wi-Fi-Guide" target="_blank">means</a> is a pretty easy process).<br /><br />I tried various solutions from the Intel support <a href="https://communities.intel.com/" target="_blank">community</a>&nbsp;but after trying it with different laptops and networks where it worked with no issues, it became clear that the issue lay somewhere in my home network.<br /><br />After trying various different configurations, I found the root turned out to be the fact my wireless router was using automatic channel selection. The solution was found when I tried to set up Airdroid to try to find if my mobile could also connect to my laptop over wifi. When I switched this to use a specific channel, all my problems disappeared. <b>Awesome!</b><br /><br />Hopefully I'll have some follow on articles in the near future but, yes, I did get an LED blinking :D
