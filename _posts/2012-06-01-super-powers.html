<div>While out cycling this evening, I discovered that my four week break (initially due to a dodgy hip injury) has had a positive and unexpected bonus - a development of hitherto underutilized powers of invisibility!<br />So far, and I believe honesty is the best policy here, I have yet to fully master control of these new gifts. I'd better explain what I mean by detailing a few highlights from my spin this evening.<br />About a minute before I unearthed my powers, I was most certainly not invisible. Pedaling on to a roundabout near the Outlet in Banbridge I spotted two kids cycling the wrong way around it. Before I had a chance to offer some safe road advice, they clocked me and shouted out "Wanker" which obviously highlighted that I was visible to normal human sight.<br />Cycling on, I exited the roundabout and tucked in behind a car that overtook me and then came up to the next roundabout. <br />No traffic was entering to the right so both the car ahead of me and I moved into the roundabout. Once the car proceeding me passed the next junction, the car that was waiting there drove onto the roundabout, cutting across me even though I was no more than six feet behind the car ahead of me.<br />Before you try and say that the guy driving the car obviously didn't spot me, I'd just like to point out that I'm over six foot tall, was wearing a bright yellow top and also had at that time a bright red face so should have been hard to miss!<br />Anyway, with awesome power comes awesome responsibility so I'll try to remember to post here with any progress I make over the next few months</div>
