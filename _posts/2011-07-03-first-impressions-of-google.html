It's been a while since I blogged, so I thought I'd get back in the saddle with a post on a hot topic at present...google+.<a name='more'></a><br/><br/>I got access to google+ on Friday (thanks TP) and have to say it quite an amazing push by Google after they'd fallen earlier with Wave and Buzz. They've obviously learned from those earlier attempts. I'll not list out how awesome each feature of it is here as other people have already done <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=is+google+plus+great%3F">that</a> but I would like to discuss a few things (one which is truly awesome and the other which shows why is might fail)<br/><br/>In the <strong>positive corner:</strong><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong></strong>is the <strong>Instant Upload</strong> feature that is part of the Android (and I assume other platforms like iPhone and Windows Phone) application. With this feature, any photos or videos that you take using the phone will be uploaded to a private album on your google+ account. From the help pages for this feature, I found this little blurb:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Unlimited photo and video uploads</strong></p><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;">As a Google+ user, you get the following</p><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;">Unlimited photo uploads. Photos larger than 2,048 by 2,048 pixels wil automatically be resized when uploading</p><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;">Unlimited video uploads (up to 15 minutes per video, up to 1080p)</p><br/></blockquote><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;">So, with this little feature, your media (all of it...forever) is pushed straight to the "cloud". Awesome. As someone whose had to go through the pain of pushing all my photos/videos to the Skydrive, this automatic feature from the phone is awesome. I'm sure other services do this, but hey, I don't use them :)</p><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Note:</strong> I have to warn you though, that this is a real <strong>battery killer</strong>, so do yourself a favor and once you have installed the app, head over to Instant Upload settings and select Battery Uploads and for Mobile Uploads select "Photos &amp; Videos via Wi-Fi only".</p><br/>In the <strong>negative corner:</strong><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;">you do have to wonder about whether google+ can push it's way into this market when Twitter and Faecbook already have such a lead? I'm not sure if the Facebook crowd would really migrate to this service now Facebook are the ubiquitous social service, but I do think twitter should be worried. If I was in Twitter, I'd be kicking myself for not having floated the company already. I think after the earlier failures, Google will not be willing to let this one fail and the range of services/features that it offers just slay twitter completely. I've heard people say that the reason that they like google+ is because "<em>their mom wouldn't get it</em>" (which I don't get...did you not get enough attention as a kid? :) but the same is true of twitter and it's the same group of people that both services will be chasing.</p><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;">Having said that, I did a general shout out on Twitter (not a lot of followers there but still only got one reply) and Facebook (only two bites from there) to say that I had access and could try to get others in. The lack of interest was underwhelming and makes me think that Google better be willing to back this service a bit better/longer in order to get enough people to make the jump. It was pleasing though to see that some of the people i stalk on Twitter (Graham Linehan for example) have already jumped and seem to be enjoying the service as much as I do.</p><br/>To close, I do wonder ifÂ there will ever be a tweetdeck update that will plug into the google+ api? I'm not sure about that on two fronts:<br/><br/>1) The API hasn't gone public yet, but you can sign up to be notified when it does <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/plusdevelopers/">here</a><br/><br/>2) As I stated above, this is potentially a twitter killer, so would it make much sense for twitter (who bought tweetdeck in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/02/twitter-to-buy-tweetdeck-for-40-million-50-million/">May</a>) to assist in the uptake of the service? I love Tweetdeck and having google+ in there would make my life so much easier.
