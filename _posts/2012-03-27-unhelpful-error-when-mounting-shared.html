Today I devoted much too much time to trying to figure out why I couldn't mount a shared directory on my Oracle VM. The error being returned from the mount command was:<br/><blockquote>/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: Protocol error</blockquote><br/>It turned out that the reason this was occurring was because I had used the wrong name for the shared folder, I used a lower case name of the shared folder directory instead of the mixed case one. So the successful command ended up looking like the following:<br/><blockquote>Â mount -t vboxsf Documents /home/user/documents</blockquote><br/>FYI: my host system is Ubuntu 11.10 and the guest OS was Centos
